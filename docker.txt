Docker :


	1. Why docker ?
		
		To install and run your software , 
		not just on your computer or laptop but on any other PC as well (on any cloud based computing platform)

		Docker makes it really easy to install and run software without worrying about setup or dependencies 


	2. Docker image 

		It is single file with all dependencies and configurations required to run a specific program

	3. Container 

		It is running instance of an image

	Docker consist of a client (Docker cli) and server (Docker daemon)
		User interacts with client and types in all the commands, these are then sent to docker daemon.
		Docker daemon handles many task like 
			- building an image,
			- creating & running a container,
			- pushing and downloading an images

	Docker is based upon linux concepts :
		1. Namespaces : 
		2. Control groups (cgroup) : 

	Docker image consist of FS snapshot and info about first command to execute.
		




Commands :

	Docker run <image-name>
		//Creates and run a container based on images. Run is equal to create container and start container

	Docker create <image-name>
		//Creates a container and returns it's ID

	Docker start -a <Container_ID>
		//Starts a container of specified ID, -a options tracks the container output

	Docker logs <Container_ID>
		//Retrives logs (output of that container instance) , can be used if container started with -a option
	
	Docker ps
		//List all the running container

	Docker ps --all
		//List down all the containers run untill now

	Docker system prune
		//Deletes all the containers in stopped state

	Docker stop <Container_ID>
		//Send a SIGTERM (terminate signal) to container, allowing it to perform cleanup and stop
		//If container does not responds to SIGTERM, after 10 seconds , a SIGKILL is issued

	Docker kill <Container_ID>
		//Send a SIGKILL command to kill that container instantly
